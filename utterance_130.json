While investing in the well-being of all children is ideal, we must also consider the practical limitations of our resources.

Pardons and commutations provide immediate relief to individuals who may not have been reached by broader systemic reforms yet. By utilizing presidential clemency powers, urgent cases of injustice can be addressed, while systemic reforms prevent future injustices.

Imagine the fear, the anxiety that can creep in when everyone does as they please, without any limits. It's like opening Pandora's Box, a whirlwind of unforeseen consequences. We must strive to protect the harmony we've worked so hard to achieve, rather than risk it all in the blind pursuit of absolute freedom."
