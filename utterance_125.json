And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I dont care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America and whether its going to make us stronger. These are dangerous times. I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world. And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans. We can lift our schools up. We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs were losing overseas. We can have health care for all Americans. We can further the cause of equality in our nation. Let me just make it clear; I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security. Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love. And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher. I believe we can do better. I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. And I ask you to embark on that journey with me. I ask you for your trust. I ask you for your help. I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever. Thank you. Goodnight. And God bless the United States of America."

But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and thats what Im talking about. But let me just address what the president just said. Ladies and gentlemen, thats just not true what he said. The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan. And you know why he gets that count? The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and hes counted as a small business. Dick Cheneys counted as a small business. Thats how they do things. Thats just not right."

By maintaining this process, we ensure that universities admit students who are most likely to excel in their academic pursuits and contribute positively to the campus community. This is supported by data showing that students admitted through rigorous admissions processes tend to have higher graduation rates and are more likely to secure high-paying jobs after graduation."

The research examined international confrontations from 1945 to 2000 and found no concrete evidence that nations armed with weapons of mass destruction were less likely to be attacked. Additionally, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons reports that the maintenance and development of these weapons cost globally."

While exposure to different viewpoints is valuable, it's essential to maintain the integrity of scientific education by focusing on evidence-based theories. By incorporating creationism into educational curricula, we risk diluting the emphasis on empirical evidence and promoting faith-based beliefs as equal to scientific facts."
