    "text": "Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. Ive consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Irans mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what weve seen over the last several years is Irans influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4, 000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now heres what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that were going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesnt have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when Im president of the United States."

A more unified system could also streamline resources, potentially making education more efficient nationwide. Also, reform could take into account the evolution of technology and its role in education, preparing students better for the future job market."

    "text": "Jim, let me just make a point. Ive got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant – from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph) , given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what Im going through. No U. S. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that theyve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can “muddle through” Afghanistan. You dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin Laden. You dont muddle through stamping out the Taliban. I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when Im president, I will."

Standardized tests provide an objective benchmark that allows for a fair comparison among all applicants.

By ensuring that late-term abortion is only performed for valid medical reasons and under strict regulations, we can address concerns about misuse while still upholding the rights and well-being of women facing difficult circumstances."
