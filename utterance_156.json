However, it's important to note that these issues can be addressed through proper regulation, transparency in algorithm development, and ethical guidelines. Many researchers and organizations are actively working on developing AI systems that are more transparent, fair, and accountable. Additionally, when it comes to job displacement, history has shown that technological advancements have often led to the creation of new types of jobs and industries.

For example, it might disincentivize people from seeking employment or pursuing higher education, which could negatively impact productivity and innovation in the long run. Additionally, funding a Universal Basic Income program would require significant financial resources, potentially leading to higher taxes or budget deficits. This could create further economic instability rather than promoting sustainable growth."

A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that specialized policies often lead to an uneven distribution of resources. In fact, 60% of all federal aid targeted for marginalized demographics is concentrated on just 20% of the population. This includes Native Americans but leaves out other disadvantaged communities. Therefore, we must ensure a balanced approach that benefits all marginalized groups and not prioritize one over the other. Only"
