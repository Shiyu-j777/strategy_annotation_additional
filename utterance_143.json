And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do. I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state. During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty. I said I did if administered fairly and justly. Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do. If its administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives. One of the things that happens when youre a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions. You cant let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law. And thats what I did, sir. There have been some tough cases come across my desk. Some of the hardest moments since Ive been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases. But my job is to ask two questions, sir. Is the person guilty of the crime? And did the person have full access to the courts of law? And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative. Im not proud of any record. Im proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas. Im proud of the fact that we hold people accountable. But Im not proud of any record, sir, Im not."

By ensuring that more individuals have access to healthcare through Medicaid, we can actually prevent more costly emergency room visits and hospitalizations, which ultimately reduces healthcare spending. Additionally, healthier individuals are more likely to be productive members of society, contributing to economic growth in the long term. By addressing the root causes of health issues early on through Medicaid coverage, we can create a healthier, more prosperous future"

    "text": "Implementing school dress codes is a moral imperative when considering the greater good of the learning environment. It fosters a sense of equality and unity among students, reducing distractions and enhancing focus. Dress codes can also discourage bullying based on clothing choices, promoting fairness and justice. It's a collective duty to create a conducive, respectful space where every student has the opportunity to succeed irrespective of their socio-economic background. This is why dress codes are not just about attire, but about nurturing a virtuous and equitable school"

He has more of the same. Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. Thats Allawis assessment. The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best- case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst- case scenario, civil war. I can do better."

There are numerous industries where creativity thrives, and this isn't always linked to the level of regulation. In addition, regulations can often provide a framework for businesses to operate within, which can help ensure standards and accountability."

    "text": "While unions may advocate for workers' rights, they can also cause economic disruptions due to strikes, leading to financial losses for businesses and the economy at large. Furthermore, union dues can be a financial burden for workers, reducing their take-home pay. This can cause financial strain, especially for low-income workers. Therefore, supporting labor unions may not always be in the best interest of workers or the economy."

It could complicate the doctor-patient relationship and introduce complexities in end-of-life decisions.

The balance you speak of seems delicate and precarious, with unforeseen consequences and ethical dilemmas waiting around the corner. It's hard for me to fully embrace the idea of surrendering control and trusting in artificial intelligence to navigate the complexities of the road, even if it promises."
