Think of it this way, civil liberties are about creating a society that respects individual rights and freedoms. It's not a matter of quantity, but rather, a question of inclusivity and fairness."

Under Vice President Gores plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965. Were talking about a massive government, folks. Were talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20, 000 new bureaucrats. Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans. There is a huge difference in this campaign. He says hes going to give you tax cuts. 50 million of you wont receive it. He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief. Thats not the role of a president to decide right and wrong. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, wont pay any tax at all. Its a huge difference. A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own."

He has more of the same. Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. Thats Allawis assessment. The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best- case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst- case scenario, civil war. I can do better."

Research has shown that countries with flexible and responsive labor market policies are better equipped to handle the disruptions caused by free trade. By investing in ongoing skills development, fostering entrepreneurship, and promoting job mobility, governments can help individuals and communities navigate the changing economic landscape more effectively. Ultimately, by combining the benefits of free trade with targeted support measures"

However, technology has evolved to handle increased traffic, and proper guidelines and regulations can be put in place to avoid legal issues.

It's crucial to find a balance between promoting equality and ensuring justice for everyone."
