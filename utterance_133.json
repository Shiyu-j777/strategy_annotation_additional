By strengthening and maintaining the FBI, we can capitalize on this existing knowledge base and infrastructure. Furthermore, the FBI has a proven track record in dealing with complex security issues, which gives it an edge over starting from scratch with a new agency."

The potential impact on individuality, genetic diversity, and societal norms necessitates a careful approach that prioritizes ethical considerations above all else. Striking a balance between progress and ethics is indeed crucial, and in the case of cloning, I believe it"

Allowing such drugs not only raises serious health concerns for the athletes themselves but also sets a dangerous precedent that success can be bought or artificially enhanced rather than earned through hard work and perseverance. True fairness in sports should revolve around ensuring equal opportunities for training and resources for all athletes, rather than resorting to shortcuts that undermine the very."

First of all on the issue of partial birth or so- called late- term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a womans life or to act if her health is severely at risk. Thats not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a womans right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti- choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a womans right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies. And I think a womans right to choose ought to be protected and defended."

While reducing poverty and insecurity is crucial, we must also consider the importance of work not only as a means of financial support but also as a source of personal fulfillment, social connection, and a way to contribute meaningfully to the community. It is essential to strike a balance between providing support for those in need and preserving the value"
