Can we really justify diverting resources abroad when there are many here who feel forgotten by their own country? Yes, trade partnerships and job opportunities sound promising, but what assurance do we have that the benefits of these advancements will trickle down to our most vulnerable citizens?"

Furthermore, regulations can control the easy access to firearms, reducing the potential for their misuse.

By holding accountable those who commit heinous crimes, we send a strong message about the value of human life and the severity of such actions. The legal system has safeguards in place to minimize the risk of wrongful convictions, and in cases where there is irrefutable evidence of guilt, capital punishment can be a justified response to ensure justice"

I am not convinced that global free trade would take into account these significant differences. Thus, I stand by my view that we should not endorse global free trade."

But when we can — when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue. I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I. And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. Thats the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to — to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes. Now, how — whats — whats the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that. Look, I — I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and its clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. And — and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Senator Obama has opposed that. We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate — alternative energies for — for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery- powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs. We can do that, we as Americans, because were the best innovators, were the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America."
