Investing in crime prevention measures, improving mental health support, and focusing on rehabilitation can also address the root causes of crime while promoting healing and justice in our society."

This is not related to potential implications, but based on a principle that the law should be interpreted as it is written. It is the job of the legislature to write laws and the judiciary to interpret them, not to enact changes."

And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short- term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long- term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And Im proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that dont have as much pollution, that dont burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, well then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months worth of oil and the oil wouldnt start flowing for many years into the future. I dont think its a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of Americas environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology."

Focusing solely on corporate corruption may divert resources and attention from more critical matters such as income inequality, climate change, or public health. These issues have far-reaching consequences that impact society as a whole, and addressing them should be our top priority to create a more equitable and sustainable future. By tackling these fundamental challenges first, we can lay a stronger foundation for addressing corporate corruption in the long run."
