However, it's crucial to remember that civil liberties are the foundation of democracy and individual rights. Without them, we risk sliding into authoritarianism and oppression. We must find a way to protect both our liberties and our safety without sacrificing one for the other."

It presents an opportunity for countries to exchange their unique offerings, thereby enriching the global marketplace. This doesn't mean they lose their national identity, rather it's an enhancement of diversity and choice."

By focusing on strengthening domestic industries and prioritizing the well-being of our workers, we can ensure a more stable and sustainable economy for our citizens. Upholding our moral duty includes protecting our own interests and ensuring the prosperity of our nation."

Let me tell you what your plan is. Its not Social Security plus, its Social Security plus huge debt. That is what it is. You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs. Its time to have a leader that doesnt put off tomorrow what we should do today. Its time to have somebody to step up and say look, lets let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets. The safest of federal investments yields 4%. Thats twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust. Its a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks. Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you. And you know what, the issue is changing. Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and thats exactly what Im going to do."

Research shows that countries focusing on such methods have seen a significant decrease in crime rates. This could lead to an overall reduction in costs associated with maintaining prisons and the judicial system."

While reducing harm and showing compassion are indeed important values, they may be interpreted and practiced differently by different people. Upholding personal beliefs and values, as long as they do not intentionally harm others, is also a crucial aspect of moral decision-making. It's crucial to approach discussions on dietary choices with an understanding of diverse ethical frameworks."

However, it's important to note that these changes could potentially provide a more accurate reflection of the voters' choice. Direct voting can eliminate the complexities of the electoral college, and spending limits can even out the playing field for all candidates. So, while these changes would indeed require careful planning and resources, they might offer a more efficient and straightforward election process."

I thought thats exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government- run health care system. It was fortunately stopped in its tracks. Secondly, we spend $4. 7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President. It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long. But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union. And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. Weve signed up over 110, 000 children to the CHIPS program. For comparable states our size, were signing them up as fast as any other state. You can quote all the numbers you want, but Im telling you we care about our people in Texas. We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and were doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured."
