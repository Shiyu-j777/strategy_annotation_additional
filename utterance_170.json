It places a heavier burden on those who can least afford it, creating more financial stress and inequality. There are better ways to promote public health, such as investing in education and affordable healthcare, that don't penalize individuals for their personal choices. Let's focus on uplifting and supporting people rather than punishing them."

Every child deserves to have enough food to eat, regardless of their family's circumstances. Federal nutrition programs play a vital role in ensuring that basic necessity is met.

Deregulation is not a one-size-fits-all solution and should be tailored to each industry. This could potentially stimulate competition and innovation, but it's crucial to understand the dynamics of each industry.

Allowing such drugs not only raises serious health concerns for the athletes themselves but also sets a dangerous precedent that success can be bought or artificially enhanced rather than earned through hard work and perseverance.
