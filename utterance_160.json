Social Security represents a commitment to ensuring that every individual, regardless of their financial situation, has the support they need to live with dignity and security. By enhancing Social Security, we uphold the values of compassion and solidarity, creating a society that truly looks out for all its members, especially those who may not have had the same opportunities for financial independence."

It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat."
