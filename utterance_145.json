Allowing such drugs not only raises serious health concerns for the athletes themselves but also sets a dangerous precedent that success can be bought or artificially enhanced rather than earned through hard work and perseverance.

And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. Its not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili."
