Under Vice President Gores plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965. Were talking about a massive government, folks. Were talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20, 000 new bureaucrats. Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans. There is a huge difference in this campaign. He says hes going to give you tax cuts. 50 million of you wont receive it. He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief. Thats not the role of a president to decide right and wrong. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.

Its a huge difference. A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own."
