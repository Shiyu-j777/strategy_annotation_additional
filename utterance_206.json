Affirmative action, when implemented thoughtfully and fairly, can help break the cycle of disadvantage and create a more inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. By addressing historical injustices and promoting diversity, we move closer to achieving true equality and justice for all individuals. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that."

It is important to address the specific needs of marginalized groups, including Native Americans, while ensuring that our efforts are broad and comprehensive, benefiting all disadvantaged communities. By striving for justice and fairness for everyone, we can create a more equitable society."

I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty. Everything is a gift from the Almighty. And as I measure the words of the Bible — and we all do; different people measure different things — the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being. And people all find their ways to express it. I was taught — I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are; Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. Theres one for the people who have, and theres one for the people who dont have. And were struggling with that today. And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith. I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead. I think weve got a lot more work to do. And as president, I will always respect everybodys right to practice religion as they choose — or not to practice — because thats part of America."

The potential benefits you mention, like extending and improving lives, could indeed be revolutionary. However, we must also consider the potential threat to human uniqueness and individuality that cloning could bring. How do we ethically balance the quest for progress with the preservation of what makes us human? Instead of rushing into this, we should consider other avenues for progress that do not risk our"

    "text": "Very much so. Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may. I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job. And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress. And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans. Thats where we were. Thats not where we are today. I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. Ive never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. Ive never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way theyre locked out today. We have to change that. And as president, I am committed to changing that. I dont care if the idea comes from the other side or this side. I think we have to come together and work to change it. And Ive done that. Over 20 years in the United States Senate, Ive worked with John McCain, whos sitting here, Ive worked with other colleagues. Ive reached across the aisle. Ive tried to find the common ground, because thats what makes us strong as Americans. And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly — not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside — but a genuine effort to try to restore Americas hope and possibilities by bringing people together. And one of the ways were going to do it is, Im going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America."
