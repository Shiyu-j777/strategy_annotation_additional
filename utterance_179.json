It's about finding a comprehensive approach that considers the diverse needs of our society. Prioritizing child welfare programs should be part of a larger strategy that takes into account the well-being of all community members."

The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. Thats the decision of the next president of the United States. Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didnt go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus."

We just have a different philosophy. Let me talk about tax relief. If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief. The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I dont think thats the role of the president to pick youre right and youre not right. I think if youre going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it. And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it. But the top 1% will end up paying one- third of the taxes in America and they get one- fifth of the benefits. And thats because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes. If youre a family of four making $50, 000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes. What Ive done is set priorities and funded them. And theres extra money. And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back. Its a difference of opinion. He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money. I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people. Its just the right position to take."

Picture their faces as they come to understand that this isn't a stepping stone, but a trap. Think about the dejection they'd feel, knowing they're just another statistic in a government program, unable to break free and forge their own path."
