Simply returning land without addressing the complexities of governance, economic development, and community relationships could result in unintended negative outcomes. It is essential to approach land rights issues with a balanced perspective that takes into account the needs and concerns of all stakeholders involved. Sustainable solutions that promote cooperation, mutual respect, and shared prosperity among diverse groups are key to building a more inclusive and harmonious society"

The concept of equal income distribution may conflict with the values of personal effort and economic freedom. Instead, the emphasis could be on enhancing opportunities for all. This is a matter of philosophical debate and is not necessarily tied to observable or measurable outcomes."

It provides a central reference point for legal matters, creating predictability in the interpretation and application of laws. This predictability can support economic stability by reducing legal risks faced by businesses. Furthermore, it can enhance the efficiency of the legal system by reducing the likelihood of prolonged legal disputes."

However, it's crucial to recognize that the primary purpose of maintaining a controlled arsenal of these weapons today is deterrence rather than use. Countries possessing such weapons are less likely to engage in direct conflict with each other due to the fear of mutually assured destruction. This concept has helped prevent major wars between nuclear-armed nations since World War II. The key lies in"

He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and hes still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions weve had about when its appropriate for the U. S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that youve laid down have given me the impression that if its something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldnt be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U. S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think its based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?"
