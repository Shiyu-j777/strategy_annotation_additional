N. and go to war as a last resort. Those words really have to mean something. And, unfortunately, he didnt go to war as a last resort. Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq — $200 billion. Its not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted."

I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but Im not for a government- run system. In fact, Im for shrinking the size of government. I want a smaller and smarter government. I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project thats reduced the size of government by more than 300, 000 people in the last several years. And the budget plan that Ive put out, according to the “Los Angeles Times” again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years. So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people. But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so- called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country. I think its intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance. So its one of my top priorities. Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this. And Im sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here. And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care — in children with health care. 49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care. So it is a priority for me. I guarantee you. Im not aware of any program — well, Ill just leave it at that. I think it ought to be a top priority."

Population shifts and demographic changes can lead to districts that are no longer balanced or representative of the current residents. Redistricting can help correct these imbalances and keep our political system up to date. Does this viewpoint make sense to you?"

Many colleges are already implementing measures like affirmative action and need-blind admissions. They're also increasing outreach programs to provide better access to resources and support for these students. Concerning implicit bias, colleges are training their staff to be more aware of it in the admissions process. Standardized testing, often criticized for favoring privileged students, is becoming less important in many admissions decisions, further leveling the"

Prioritizing deficit reduction alongside strategic investments can help prevent excessive government debt accumulation, which could burden future generations and limit our ability to respond to unforeseen economic challenges. By carefully managing both deficit reduction and investments, we can create a more resilient and prosperous economy for years to come. How do you think we can ensure that"

This could potentially lead to boredom and lack of interest in what they're wearing. Furthermore, research has shown that there is no significant correlation between uniforms and improved academic performance or behavior. Lastly, implementing a uniform policy may incur additional costs for families, as they would have to purchase specific items that conform to the uniform policy. So, from a practical standpoint, it might not be the best approach."
