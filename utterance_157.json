One crucial aspect to consider is the ethical implications surrounding AI, especially in terms of decision-making and privacy. The reliance on AI systems that are not thoroughly regulated or transparent can lead to unintended consequences, such as bias in algorithms or data breaches. It's essential to prioritize the ethical use of AI to ensure that it benefits society as a whole without compromising fundamental values and rights"

According to World Population Review, Singapore ranked 161 out of 182 countries in terms of crime rate in 2020. Moreover, a survey by the Institute of Policy Studies in Singapore revealed that 80% of respondents believe that corporal punishment has been effective in deterring crime. Therefore, there's a need to consider implementing corporal punishment based on these empirical evidences."

Prioritizing deficit reduction alongside strategic investments can help prevent excessive government debt accumulation, which could burden future generations and limit our ability to respond to unforeseen economic challenges. By carefully managing both deficit reduction and investments, we can create a more resilient and prosperous economy for years to come. How do you think we can ensure that"

One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money. We have to get a handle on it. And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and its not a new position for me. 24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections. And anybody who thinks Im just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress. I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law."
